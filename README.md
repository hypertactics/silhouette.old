## What silhouette does

Buils a static system profile for your *nix profiles tools like Chef, Ansible or Rex.  This expands on the idea of profiles of profiles.  Allowing you to create mutiple profile sets that you can cherry pick from.  It helps me to think of it like Jykell but for Bash, Zsh and Fish.

## Current Support
Currently supports Ruby/Chef and Bash.  Future releases will have Python/Ansible and Perl/Rex, javascript/NodeJs supporting Zsh and Fish shells.
